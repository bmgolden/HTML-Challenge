# HTML-Challenge


Web Scraping Module 

Brendan Golden 


This assignment required using and implementing HTML and data scraping concepts to extrapolate text and table contents from the website provided in the starter code. Using basic web scraping techniques I extracted the titles and previews of the articles for the first part and all of the rows and data from the specific table for the latter. After using basic pandas techniques in creating and manipulating a data frame, I was able to successfully answer all of the questions and create the necessary graphs. I was able to complete all of the analytical questions within the Jupyter Notebook and at the end in the provided cells. Answering the questions was relatively simple using both analytical and visual methods such as functions and graphs, objectively determining which months have the lowest and highest average temperature and atmospheric pressure. The last question took some reasoning. After plotting the final graph depicting the average temperature for each day in the data set, I determined a year on Mars to be around 680 days by analyzing the repetition in the average temperatures and finding when the pattern began to repeat itself over the entire period. All in all, this module was a very effective implementation of concepts taught in class for this specific unit and an application of older techniques in a new and inventive way.
